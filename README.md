# AMAZON_Web_Scarping
Data scraping of AMAZON products with BEST SELLER badge's.

Code uploaded on 13th June, 2021.

This code includes data scraping of all the sub-categories of COMPUTER Category of AMAZON.

Using Task 1 file, you can scrape the data and save the data in "DVIZ Test.xlsx" file. 
Using Task 2 file, you can view and convert the specific category prodcuts into a list.

I have used chrome web driver, but you can use anyother and for that you have to change the code as well.

This code was baiscally a test assignment and not a proper AMAZON Web Scraper. It is only scraping the name of the product and the best seller badge.

Libraries I have used in the scraper are: SELENIUM, BEAUTIFULSOUP, PANDAS, TIME & XLWT.
